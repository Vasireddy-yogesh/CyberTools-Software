## 🚀 Features

### 🕵️ 1. Phishing Detection
- Detects malicious or suspicious URLs using a trained **Machine Learning model**.  
- Monitors copied links from browsers, emails, and other sources.  
- Automatically shows threat alerts for unsafe URLs.  
- Built using **Python**, **FastAPI**, and **pandas**.

### 🔥 2. Firewall Management
- Implements custom **Windows CMD rules** to block or allow specific ports, IPs, or applications.  
- Provides options to **enable, disable, or reset** Windows Firewall settings.  
- Automates rule creation for safer network control.

### 🌐 3. VPN (Virtual Private Network)
- Secures network traffic through **Python-based tunneling and encryption**.  
- Ensures anonymity and privacy while browsing or connecting to remote systems.  
- Can be integrated with external VPN libraries or APIs.

### 🧠 4. EDR (Endpoint Detection & Response)
- Monitors system activities to detect unusual behavior.  
- Tracks running processes, resource usage, and potential threats.  
- Built using Python system monitoring libraries.
